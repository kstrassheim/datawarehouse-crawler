# datawarehouse-crawler
This is a content and schema crawler tool to receive, update and import various kinds of data into a Onprem or Cloud based SQLServer or Azure-Synapse-Analysis (Azure Datawarehouse SQLServer). As source it supports SQLServer Tables, ODATA Endpoints, CSV Files or Excel Files. For multiple sources it can run in parallel mode where it would make a thread for each connection. The speciality of this crawler is that it creates the target tables by himself using the additional info from source.json. In case of Azure-Synapse-Analysis it would estimate the distribution type and keys. The syncing works completely without SQL Transactions by using a consistency correction algorithm for very frequent fact tables. There are 5 Syncing Algorithms (see Manual/Insert) which can be selected as well as one Update Algorithm.
